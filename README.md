install: Download the repo as a zip file or just version folder.



To install the mods:

Start by going to the default minecraft launcher and launch the desired vanilla version.

Go to the version folder and grab the fabric intaller.

Execute the installer on your desktop. If it doesn't work use the universal .jar instead.

Select the correct version and install fabric.

To access \.minecraft\mods\ just search %appdata% in the windows search bar.

Next grab the mods folder from the download and put it inside \.minecraft\

(Don't put the mods folder inside the mods folder, replace it with).

Now open the game using fabric in the default minecraft launcher.
